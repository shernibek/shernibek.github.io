<p> Modern Semey, a bustling university town, has a population exceeding 300,000. Because of its proximity to the Kazakh border with the Russian Federation, and the large scientific community attached to the STS labs and the university, which includes many Russians, Semey is said to have a more Russian character than other cities in Kazakhstan. </p>

<p>Semipalatinsk Oblast merged with the larger East Kazakhstan Region, whose capital city is Oskemen, on 23 May 1997. </p>
<p> The Semey Bridge, a suspension bridge across the Irtish River, connects the two major parts of Semey. It has a main span of 750 metres (2,460 ft) and a total length of 1,086 metres (3,563 ft).  Construction began in 1998 and the bridge opened to traffic in November 2000. </p>
<p> In 2007 the Semipalatinsk City Council voted unanimously in favour of changing the name of the city to Semey. The Chairman said that existing name had negative associations because of the extensive atomic testing there. </p>
<p> In March 2022, Semey was selected by President Tokayev as the prospective capital of the new Abay Region. This came into force on 8 June 2022 when Abay Region became an official Region of Kazakhstan.  </p>
